# Epoch - New Chrome Tab Extension.

## Description

I wanted to be reminded how much time is passing every time I opened a new tab. I made this with Flex box and vanilla JavaScript. I created the earth and moon svg's with Sketch. I'm delighted to say that this is being used by real users in the Chrome Web store.

## Tech Stack

- HTML 5
- CSS
- Flex box
- Vanilla JavaScript
- SVG made with Sketch App

## What I Learned

This was a fun project because it held quite a few firsts for me:

- First original vector image I've ever created
- First time I've animated a vector image
- First use of Flex box in a production project
- First new tab Chrome extension I've ever made
- First Chrome extension I've ever published
